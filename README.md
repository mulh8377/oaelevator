Dependencies included below are to demonstrate using some of the modern tools found in a typical python project.

- pytest
- ruff
- mypy 

I decided to also use a new tool developed by astral called uv for
the package & project management. This single tool handles the dependencies above, virtual environments, etc. It should make the CI/CD environment much faster for installing dependencies; who doesn't like faster pipelines?
